<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please ensure you have **Bun** installed (instead of Node.js). You can install it via the official [Bun website](https://bun.sh/).
</Info>

Follow these steps to set up the development environment for **AdventShare**:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Clone the repository if you havenâ€™t already:

<CodeGroup>
```bash git
git clone https://github.com/CSIS-315-Project/AdventShare.git
cd AdventShare
```
</CodeGroup>

Then install the project dependencies using Bun:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bun
bun install
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file to .env and fill in the necessary values for Supabase, Clerk, and any other required environment variables:

<CodeGroup>
```bash 
 cp .env.example .env
```
</CodeGroup>

Make sure all necessary keys (Supabase, Clerk, etc.) are added to the .env file before proceeding.

### Step 3: Run the Development Server
Start the development server:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bun
bun dev
```
</CodeGroup>
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to preview the project locally.

### Custom Ports
By default, the development server runs on port 3000. If you want to change the port, you can specify it when running the development server:

<CodeGroup> 
```bash bun
bun dev --port 3333 
``` 
</CodeGroup>
If the default port is already in use, Bun will automatically attempt to use the next available port.


### Code Formatting
For a consistent code style across the project, we recommend using Prettier and setting up ESLint in your IDE. If you're using VSCode, consider installing these extensions:

[Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

This will help keep your codebase clean and standardized.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Could not install dependencies using Bun">
    This may happen if you're using an outdated version of Bun. Try upgrading to the latest version by running:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash bun
      bun upgrade
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Development server not starting">
    Make sure all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file. If the server still doesn't start, try clearing the cache:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash bun
      bun install --force
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
